#### How It Works:
```javascript
// Click category button in sidebar
filterGamesByCategory(categoryId, categoryName)
  ↓
// Fetch games from API with category filter
fetch('admin/api/games.php?category=' + categoryId)
  ↓
// Update games grid on same page
displayFeaturedGames(filteredGames)
  ↓
// Highlight active category button
```
