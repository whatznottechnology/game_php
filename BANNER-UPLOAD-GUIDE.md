**Design Tips:**
- Use eye-catching visuals related to the game
- Include game logo or branding
- Avoid too much text in the image
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend Display

Banner images are displayed in:
1. **Home Page** - Featured games grid
2. **Games Listing** - All games grid
3. **Search Results** - Filtered games

All images are responsive and automatically adjust to screen size.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Automatic Upload**: Images are automatically uploaded when you submit the form
- **Backup Original**: Keep a copy of your original images before uploading
- **File Naming**: System automatically renames files to prevent conflicts
- **Directory Creation**: The `assets/img/games/` folder is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- **Existing Images**: When editing, if you don't select a new image, the existing banner is retained

### üîß Technical Details

**Upload Handling:**
```php
// File upload location
$uploadDir = '../assets/img/games/';

// Allowed file types
$allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];

// Max file size
$maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB

// File naming convention
$fileName = $slug . '-' . time() . '.' . $fileExtension;
```

**Frontend Display:**
```javascript
// Banner is displayed from database path
<img src="${game.banner_image}" alt="${game.name}">

// Example path: assets/img/games/cricket-betting-1697123456.jpg
```

### üéØ Quick Start - Seed Database

If you want to quickly populate your site with sample games and banners:

1. Visit: `http://localhost:8000/admin/seed-database.php`
2. Click "Seed Database" button
3. Database will be populated with 15 games
4. All games will have professional CDN banner images
5. Login to admin and start editing/replacing banners with your own images

### üìä Alternative: Use CDN Images

Instead of uploading images, you can also:
1. Use image URLs from CDN services (Unsplash, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Enter the full URL in the banner field
3. Example: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-123...`

This method:
- ‚úÖ Saves server storage
- ‚úÖ Faster loading (served from CDN)
- ‚úÖ No upload needed
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå Depends on external service

### üÜò Troubleshooting

**Problem: Image not uploading**
- Check file size (must be under 2MB)
- Check file format (JPG, PNG, GIF only)
- Ensure `assets/img/games/` folder has write permissions

**Problem: Image not showing on frontend**
- Verify the image path in database
- Check if image file exists in `assets/img/games/`
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

**Problem: Image quality is poor**
- Upload higher resolution images (800x450 recommended)
- Use JPG format with 80-90% quality
- Avoid over-compression
